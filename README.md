<p>In this repository is the code of the exploratory analysis of the [Kaggle 2015 Flight Delays and Cancellations](https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays) dataset, made by me.</p>

<p>A simple exploratory analysis was carried out regarding three aspects: the airlines that most delayed flights in the period, the airports that concentrated the highest volume of delays, and the days of the week that the most delayed flights. The reasons for the delays were not explored in depth, something that can be discussed in a future analysis.</p>

<p>Due to the size of the tables used in this analysis, I suggest that you download them from Kaggle to your local repository, as they were not included in that repository.</p>
